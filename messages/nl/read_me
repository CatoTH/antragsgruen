All the files which have a _NL_incomplete extension in the title, are documents which have correct NL translations, but might miss some strings.

All the files which have neither, are combined files with the above two. So they have a complete list of strings, and can be translated.

You can start to translate the following files:
- admin.php
- amend.php
