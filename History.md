## Version 3.3 (2016-05-06)

- There is now a activity page for every consultation, listing all bigger events of this consultation in a timeline
- The administration has been split up into three separate parts: the Motion List, the To Do List and the Settings Page

- Bugfix: Inserted / Deleted paragraphs were not formatted as such in the OpenDocument-Export

### Version 3.2.3 (2016-04-15)

- Using the enter key when creating an amendment does not create a new paragraph anymore, but only a line break. This is a "hack" to improve the diff.
- Editorial hints in amendments are no shown in the admin backend (and can be edited)
- Bugfix: In some cases, single lines were shown as modified with deletions where no deletion was actually made.
- Bugfix: When amendments are numbered by the first affected line number, the numbering got wrong once more than two amendments started at the same line.

## Version 3.2 (2016-04-03)

- We now support a "support collection phase", where a motion has to be supported by a given number of supporters before it is officially published.
- Motions now have a more verbose URL including a secure token. The URL of unpublished motions is therefore not guessable anymore.
- Support database table prefixes
- Support policy of motions and amendments can now be set independently
- Compiled assets (stylesheets, scripts) are now included in the repository. This makes installation from the repository a lot easier.
- To-Do-Items on the admin page are now sorted (by date)
- The supporters of a motion/amendment can now be reorderd in the backend using drag&drop
- The "Help" link in the menu is only shown after explicitly created by the admin (on the admin page) 
- Bugfix: creating a new consultation based on a template did not clone the motion sections and therefore created empty motion types
- Bugfix: Dangling &nbsp;'s at the end of a line were not stripped at a motion, but at the amendments.
- Bugfix: Motions with section-based comments could not be edited in the admin-screen
- Bugfix: a security problem was fixed that occurred under the following two conditions: 1) Everyone can create a motion, without login and 2) Supporting motions was enabled
- Bugfix: when global line numbering was enabled, unscreened motions could not be viewed by the admin
- Bugfix: the amendment creation view showed the creation policy for motions, not for amendments
- Bugfix: the "tag"-based home page was buggy in several ways
