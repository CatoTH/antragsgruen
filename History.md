# Version history

## Version 4.0.0 (2018-09-01)

- Antragsgrün now includes an update mechanism to install new versions from the web interface.
- The comment system was improved:
  - It is now possible to reply to comments. The replies will be displayed indented below the main comment.
  - The layout of comments is more compact and less visually cluttered.
  - Now it is easier and more flexible to get e-mail-notifications about comments to motions/amendments: when writing comments, it is possible to opt-in to e-mail-notifications about new comments, either for comments to the same motion, for direct replies, and for all comments to the same consultation.
- The system for editorial texts (like the legal pages or the welcome message) has been overhauled. New features include:
  - It is now possible to upload images using drag&drop when editing editorial texts.
  - It is now possible to create new editorial content pages, optionally linked to from the main menu.
  - It is now possible to add a login message, that appears above the login screen.
- Instead of only setting the deadline for motions and amendments, there is now an alternative complex phase system with time ranges for motions, amendments, comments and merging amendments into motions, including a debugging tool for admins.
- The RSS-feeds are now embedded in the header of the consultation page, making them auto-discoverable.
- If the "amendment merging" mode of a motion is used just to create a new version of the motion, and no amendments actually exist, the process is now greatly simplified.
- There now can be more than only one "pink create-motion button" in the sidebar. This can be configured on a per-motion-type basis.
- There are first beginnings of a plugin system based on Yii2's module concept. It's still subject to major changes, though.
- On the user account page, there now is a tool to export all user data in JSON-format.
- It is easier to create PDF-based application motion types, as there now is a template for that when creating a new motion type.
- Selecting the site layout and PDF layout is now done using thumbnails of the layouts, not by their rather cryptic names.
- The PDF-introduction of a motion can now be set on a per-motion-type basis.
- The sender name and reply-to of sent emails can now be set on a per-consultation-base (it was on a per-site-base before).
- The logo of a consultation can (and has to be) uploaded now in the consultation settings. This enables using it as PDF-logo, and prevents mixed secure content warnings.
- It is now possible to specify the visibility of the page in search engines / set the noindex-tag. By default, only the home page is indexable. Alternatively, everything or nothing can be set to indexable.
- In the regular motion view, it is now possible to go to a specific line by simply typing in the line number and pressing enter.
- Add a way to include the commercial FPDI-PDF-plugin.
- It is now possible to restrict the access to one consultation to specific users, while leaving other consultations open for all.
- In installations that use SAML/Grünes Netz for authentication, it is now possible to restrict the login to a specified list of users.
- Improve compatibility with reverse proxies.
- The default consultation path is not "std12345678" (random number) anymore, bust simply "std".
- When creating a motion and it is not clear what agenda item it should belong to, the agenda item can now be set from the motion creation form.
- Image and PDF upload fields in motions / applications now show the maximum file size.
- When creating a motion, optional fields are now marked as such.
- Bugfix: Improved compatibility with servers that do not support URL rewriting ("pretty" URLs).
- Bugfix: When creating a new version of a motion and changing the motion type of this new motion afterwards, the changes between the two versions could not be displayed.
- Bugfix: When Latex was not activated, new consultations were created with no PDF after saving the motion type the first time.
- Bugfix: The list of tags to select when creating a motion is now sorted in the same way as in the consultation setting page.
- Bugfix: When a section was completely empty in a motion and a amendment was created inserting something to this section, the original motion could not be displayed anymore.
- Bugfix: When a motion type's create setting was set to "nobody", editing already created motions as an admin was impossible.
- Bugfix: When creating a new version of a motion, it was not possible to merge none of the amendments.
- Bugfix: After changing the line length, the old line was still in the cache for LaTeX-based PDF rendering.
- Bugfix: When submitting an application containing a photo and the admin enabled submission confirmations by e-mail, the confirmation e-mail did not corretly link to the image.
- Obsolete: The old, non-fuctional OpenID-based Wurzelwerk-login was removed.
- Obsolete: The facebook image feature was removed, as nobody used it and was rather tricky to use anyway.

### Version 3.8.3 (2018-05-12)

- Bugfix: At ByLDK PDF Layout, the default introduction was shown all the times at amendments.

- Bugfix: When editing a motion in the backend without changing the submission/resulution date, the seconds in the timestamp were unnecessarily reset to zero.
- Bugfix: Removing other admins from a consultation was not possible with some browsers.
- Internal: Vendor prefixes are now added by default, slightly increasing the size of the CSS, but therefore adding some extra browser compatibility.

## Version 3.8.0 (2018-03-10)

- Proposed procedures for motions and amendments
  - Administrators of a consultation can now manage the proposed procedure of a motion / amendment. This includes setting a proposed status, a modified version of the amendment text.

  - Motions and amendments can be grouped into voting blocks to indicate which ones are mutually exclusive in case of a voting.
  - The proposed procedure and the voting blocks are optionally published on a separate page.
- After replacing a motion by a new version, e.g. by merging amendments, there is now a view comparing both versions of the motions. That way, it is much easier to see what has actually changed.

- Bugfix: A bug in the line numbering after manual line breaks was fixed.
- Bugfix: A multi-page PDF that was uploaded as part of a application and then exported as PDF again, collided with the tabular data of the application.
- Bugfix: When it's allowed to select multiple tags when creating a motion, the tag selection required to select all tags at once.
- Bugfix: The "Create a motion"-Button in the agenda did not work if the user was not logged in and creating a motion required being logged in.
- Bugfix: When downloading the PDF-collection of motions / amendments, the file extension was sometimes lost.
- Bugfix: When merging amendments into a motion that already had "NEU" / "NEW" in the prefix, the program could crash due to inconsistent handling of upper-/lowercase
- Bugfix: The Open Document generation is now a bit more tolerant towards unsupported HTML tags
- Bugfix: When an admin created an user account in the backend, sending e-mails to that user did not work.
- Internal: Refactoring of the layout hooks, allowing more site-specific custom codes.

## Version 3.7.5 (2017-11-15)

Thanks to Eric Sesterhenn of [X41 D-SEC GmbH](https://www.x41-dsec.de/) for reporting this issue.

- Bugfix: Sorting of amendments on the consultation page is fixed
- The appearance of amendments and withdrawn and modified motions/amendments was slightly improved on the consultation page
- The name of the initiator of an amendment is added to the e-mail-notifications about its publication
- On the public version of the amendment merging draft, the code of an amendment is shown after the change. Furthermore, it is now possible to open the amendment-diff-popup and the normal amendment page by clicking on a single change  
- The header of the amendment merging page (editing mode and public version) is now sticky 

## Version 3.7.2 (2017-10-21)

- Bugfix: Motions / applications with tabular data could not be saved from within the admin backend
- Bugfix: An empty agenda item code lead to a crash in the home page of a consultation
- Bugfix: It was possible to set a broken urlPath of a consultation, so parts of the site would not work anymore

## Version 3.7.1 (2017-09-30)

- The ODS-Export of amendments now include a column with the status of the amendments
- Bugfix: Several Bugs in the LaTeX-based PDF-export have been fixed:
  - Nested enumerated lists were not rendered correctly
  - Headings (H1-H6) in combination with line numbers lead to extra line numbers after the heading
- Bugfix: ByLDK-PDF-Template did not respect the introduction text specified in the consultation settings
- Bugfix: When using TCPDF-based PDF-rendering, BR-tags lead to double newlines
- Bugfix: ODS-Export of Amendments could not be read by some versions of LibreOffice

## Version 3.7.0 (2017-09-03)

- Initiators of motions can now merge amendments into their motions, if this is allowed by the consultation settings. This function can be restricted to cases where no amendment rewriting is necessary.
- Proposers of motions now can receive an e-mail if a amendment to their motion is published (enabled by default)
- When merging all amendments into the motion at once...
  - drafts are saved periodically and can be set as public. This way, regular users have read-only access to the current work-in-progress draft of the revised motion.
  - when a paragraph of an amendment lead to a collission with changes made by another amendment, all changes of that paragraph of that amendment were marked as colliding. Now, we include as many changes as possible into the merged version and only leave the actually colliding changes in the colliding paragraph below the merged version. This reduces the amount of necessary manual work.
  - it is now possible to exclude some amendments from merging, to prevent lots of collissions for amendments that replace major parts of the motion
- Replacing several consecutive paragraphes in an amendment is now displayed in a more sensible way (first all deletions in a row, then all insertions; they were alternating before)
- Administrators can now be set per consultation, without granting them access to all consultations of this site
- It's possible to change the motion type of a motion now after creating it. However, this works only between motion types that are structurally similar.
- Amendments can now be marked as "global alternatives", replacing the whole content of a motion. Their contents will not be displayed using an inline diff, as this does not make sense in this case. When merging a global alternative into a motion, the motion will be replaced completely, and no amendments will be moved to the new version of the motion.
- If a motion or amendment is created using another one as template by an admin, the text is cloned as well, not only the initiators.
- Several improvements to the inline editing of the agenda
- A more detailed manual about the functionality of Antragsgrün is provided
- The timestamp of a motion or amendment now shows the time when it has been officially submitted, not when the first draft has been created. The latter is still shown before the submission.
- Strike-Through formatting is not allowed anymore in motion sections that are amendable, as this messed up the amendment function.
- Improvements to the Installer
- We don't pretend anymore you could use Antragsgrün with IE <=9
- Updates to several core libraries
- Redis, Excel and SAML Authentication is not part of the default installation anymore, reducing the size of the package. It can still be installed as an optional dependency, though.
